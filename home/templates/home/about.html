                <p class="lead">Crochet is a popular craft technique that involves creating fabric from yarn or thread using a hook.
                     The word "crochet" comes from the French term for "small hook," referring to the tool used to create interlocking
                     loops of yarn. Unlike knitting, which uses two needles, crochet is done with a single hook,
                     making it a versatile and relatively easy technique for beginners to pick up.The art of crochet has been
                     around for centuries, with roots tracing back to ancient civilizations. Today, it's a favorite hobby and
                     artistic form for people worldwide, used to create everything from practical items like blankets and 
                     scarves to intricate decorative pieces.
