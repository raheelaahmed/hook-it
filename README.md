## UX
### Colour Scheme:

For my project, Iâ€™ve chosen a well-balanced color scheme that combines subtle tones with a professional, clean look. For the text color, I opted for a slightly darker shade of grey. This choice enhances readability while maintaining a modern and sophisticated feel. The darker grey provides sufficient contrast against the lighter background, ensuring that the content is easy to read without being too harsh or overwhelming, as black text might be. This approach allows for a more refined, comfortable user experience, while also contributing to the overall aesthetic of the design.

# bugs and fixes:

foreign key error in serch term

![foriegn-key-error](documents/screenshots/foriegn-key-error.png)

solution:

Since category is a foreign key, we can't filter it with icontains directly as if it were a CharField. we need to filter based on a field within the related Category model, like category__name__icontains.
